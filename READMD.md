This is a simple implementation of RSA following RFC 2313, 
with the encryption block format being based on PKCS #1 v1.5.

We heavily borrow the implementation from Eli Bendersky's [codes](https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/master/2019/rsa)
and recommend reading his [excellent blog post about RSA](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2019/rsa-theory-and-implementation/#footnote-5)
